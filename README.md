# Learn React
Notes adapted from the book, __Learing React__. While the book is a good resource, many of the methods described are deprecated or obselete. 

## Excluded Chapters
I excluded sections of the book that were either redundant (covering standard JavaScript) or obselete (React and its recommended practices have changed). Chapters I intentionally removed include: 
- chapter 01: introduction & installing Node.js
- chapter 02: emerging JavaScript (ES6)
- chapter 03: functional programming tenets
- chapter 10: testing apps with Jest  

## react-app
I created demos for new theories and concepts on [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io), a fast prototyping web development tool. Many of the chapter folders also contain a sub-directory called `react-app`, which includes a simple React setup to display concepts (configuring Webpack, component file structure, creating Redux dispatchers) that required a Node.js environment.
